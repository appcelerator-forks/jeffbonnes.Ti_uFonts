An example of convention over configuration for custom fonts in Titanium for iOS and Android.

Just drop fonts in the 'fonts' directory, add the yy.tidynamicfont module, and require( 'ufonts' ).  It will load all fonts dynamically.

Note: to make it really easy, rename the filename of the font to the PostScript name.  See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/79875/how-can-i-get-the-postscript-name-of-a-ttf-font-installed-in-os-x on how to find the PostScript name.

The ufonts.fonts object will also contain map of all the custom loaded fonts.
